### Project:

A quote generator for the FreeCodeCamp Front End Libraries Curriculum (made before the 2017 curriculum update)

### The Problem:

Create a one-page "Random quote machine" for a chosen subject in the style of [this site](https://codepen.io/freeCodeCamp/full/qRZeGZ).
  
* Must complete a series of [user stories](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/front-end-libraries/front-end-libraries-projects/build-a-random-quote-machine)

* Must be aesthetically pleasing and mobile friendly.

### Why Buffy?

"Buffy the Vampire Slayer", a show I only watched around 2010, has some of the best character and story arcs of a long-running fantasy tv show, as well as progressive examples of relationships and strong feminist (and funny) characters. Buffy will always be one of my heroes.

### Technologies Used:

HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

### Future upgrades:

I would like to improve the design and make it mildly less tacky while still revelling in the early aughts vibe.
